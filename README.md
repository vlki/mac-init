# Mac init

Scripts for quickly getting a new Mac up to speed.

Why not dotfiles repo? I used to have one, but it was just unnecesarilly complex. These scripts are much more compact.

## Steps

```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:vlki/mac-init.git
cd mac-init
./1-homebrew.sh
./2-bash-shell.sh
./3-dotfiles.sh
./4-dev-environment.sh
./5-apps.sh
./6-macos-config.sh
```

# Thanks

Mainly to [Mathias's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) for the extensive configuration options he has there.
